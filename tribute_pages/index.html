      <p>
        Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and
        futurist, born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan (now part of Croatia) and
        passing away on January 7, 1943, in New York City. He is best known for
        his groundbreaking contributions to the development of alternating
        current (AC) electrical systems. Tesla began his career in electrical
        engineering in Europe before immigrating to the United States in 1884.
        In the U.S., he worked with Thomas Edison briefly before the two parted
        ways due to differing views on electrical systems. Tesla then
        collaborated with George Westinghouse, advocating for AC power
        distribution over Edison's direct current (DC) system. His inventions
        and innovations laid the foundation for the modern electrical power
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of Tesla's notable contributions include the development of the
        induction motor and transformer, the Tesla coil for radio frequency
        transmission, and advances in X-ray technology. His work on wireless
        transmission of energy and communication, including the ambitious but
        ultimately unrealized Wardenclyffe Tower project, demonstrated his
        visionary ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his significant achievements, Tesla struggled financially later
        in life and lived in relative obscurity. His ideas often surpassed the
        technological capabilities of his time, and he remained more focused on
        scientific exploration than commercial success. In recent years, Nikola
        Tesla has gained posthumous recognition for his pioneering work in
        electricity and magnetism, and he is celebrated as one of history's most
        brilliant inventors and visionaries.

          <b>
            <li>1888: Alternating Current (AC) Power System:</li>
          </b>
          <p>
            Nikola Tesla developed an efficient system for distributing
            electrical power based on alternating current. This system is widely
            used today in most of the world's electrical grids.
          </p>
          <b>
            <li>1891: Tesla Coil:</li>
          </b>
          <p>
            Tesla invented the Tesla Coil, a device that generates
            high-frequency currents and extremely high voltages. This invention
            was crucial for experiments in electricity and radio.
          </p>
          <b>
            <li>1893: Chicago World's Fair - Wireless Lighting:</li>
          </b>
          <p>
            Tesla demonstrated wireless transmission of electrical energy at the
            Chicago World's Fair, illuminating lamps without wires at a
            considerable distance.
          </p>
          <b>
            <li>1895: Earthquake Machine:</li>
          </b>
          <p>
            Tesla experimented with mechanical resonance and claimed he could
            build a machine capable of generating earthquakes. Although never
            constructed, this concept is fascinating.
          </p>
          <b>
            <li>1901: Wardenclyffe Tower - Wireless Energy Transmission:</li>
          </b>
          <p>
            The Wardenclyffe Tower was conceived to transmit energy wirelessly
            over long distances. Although the project was abandoned, it laid the
            groundwork for future technologies.
